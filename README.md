# ðŸš—The Complete Self-Driving Car Course :  Applied Deep Learning 
## Project Description

* This course aims to harness the power behind deep learning & computer vision to build a fully functional self-driving car. Cars are typically driven around and trained on real roads by manual drivers and then they are trained on data and clone the behavior of manual drivers!

* We used the **Udacity simulator** to take images in the movement of the car (3 laps in both directions to avoid biased samples)
  * **X-train** = snapshot
  * **y-train**  = steering angle
* Input the Xtrain  into a CNN network in order to train model to adjust the steering angle
