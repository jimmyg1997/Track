# The Complete Self-Driving Car Course -  Applied Deep Learning 
## Welcome to the Repository for Self-Driving Car Course

* This course aims to harness the power behind deep learning & computer vision to build a fully functional self-driving car. Cars are typically driven around and trained on real roads by manual drivers and then they are trained on data and clone the behavior of manual drivers!

* We used the Udacity simulator to take images in the movement of the car (3 laps in both directions to avoid biased samples)
  $$X_{train} = snapshot, y_{train} = steering angle$$

* Input the $X_{train}$ into a CNN network in order to train model to adjust the steering angle
